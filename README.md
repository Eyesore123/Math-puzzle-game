# Math quiz game

* This is a game where you answer simple math questions and get points for answering correctly. You also lose points for answering incorrectly.

In order to complete this game, you need to do some mental calculation. 

Choose from three diffculty levels: easy, medium or hard.

Math questions are randomly generated.

The game works but it's still a work in progress. I intend to add a leaderboard, a game ending screen, perhaps a timer and a few other things. Infernal difficulty mode would be nice too.
